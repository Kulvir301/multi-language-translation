=Multi-Language Translation Script - Documentation=

==Introduction==

The Multi-Language Translation script automatically translates a web-page (containing text in more than one language) into any single language requested by the user. This can be particularly useful for sites involving a lot of user-generated content (which might have originally been written by a number of users who speak different native languages) - e.g. blogs, forums, or other community sites. The script harnesses the [http://code.google.com/intl/en/apis/ajaxlanguage/ Google AJAX Language API] to perform translation and language detection.

This page provides full instructions on how to use the script and deploy it on your website, providing examples where necessary. It also attempts to answer any additional questions you may have, as well as to outline ways you can support the project if you wish to do so. All feedback - both on this documentation and on the script itself - would be much appreciated.

==Deployment and Usage Instructions==

This section explains how to deploy the script on your website. Before following these instructions, please first [http://code.google.com/p/multi-language-translation/downloads/list download] the latest script release, and extract all files from the archive into a new folder on your computer.

===Step 1:===
 
Firstly, you need to include the following 2 HTML lines within the {{{<head>}}} tags of all web-pages that use the script:

{{{
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://www.google.com/jsapi"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="translate.js"></script>
}}}

If you use a _Content Management System_ to maintain your site (either a generic one such as [http://www.drupal.org Drupal], or a bespoke one), you will probably only have to do this once in a header file. If your site is made up of static HTML pages however, you will need to repeat this step for all pages you wish the translation functionality to work on.

Please ensure that if you intend to upload the script to a different folder from where your web-pages are located, you update the {{{src}}} value to the location of your script (e.g {{{src="scripts/translate.js"}}} or {{{src="http://www.example.com/scripts/translate.js"}}})

===Step 2:===

Include the following HTML code somewhere on every page using the script:

{{{
<div id="languagelist"></div>
}}}

If you use a _CMS_, you could place this code in a _Block_, _Widget_, or top banner, so that a language list will appear either on a sidebar or at the top of every page of your site. Otherwise, please include the code on every page which needs to support the translation functionality. 

At the precise location that you place this code on each page, a listbox will be generated by the script every time the page loads, which contains all the languages it is currently possible to translate your site into (note: each language should be auto-translated to allow native speakers to easily find their language, and the list will show additional languages automatically as and when Google supports them). If the user changes the language, the specified content (see [#Step_3: Step 3]) will be translated into that language. The script will also remember the language they pick; so that if they visit the page again later, or visit another page on your site which includes the translation functionality, the relevant page can be translated again. There is also an _Original Languages_ option at the top of the listbox, which will return the user to the original untranslated site (this is also the default option if they have not yet chosen a language). 

Note: if the user has !JavaScript disabled, the listbox will not appear (which does prevent further confusion from arising, as it prevents such users from trying to change language - which would in any case not work unless !JavaScript was enabled). If you wish, you can display a message to the user between the {{{<div>}}} tags - e.g.

{{{
<div id="languagelist">Enable JavaScript!</div>
}}}

This message will not be shown unless !JavaScript is disabled or not supported by the user's browser...

Directly below the listbox containing the languages, a _Powered By Google_ attribution message will be shown. This is a requirement of the [http://code.google.com/intl/en/apis/ajaxlanguage/terms.html Google AJAX Language API Terms of Use].

===Step 3:===

Open the file _translate.js_. You need to make some configurations to the top of this script file to enable it to work with your website:

====Step 3(a):====

Specify the _Base Language_ for your website. This is the language the site was originally written in, and is normally the language used for all regions which appear on every page and do not change throughout the site - e.g. navigational elements such as links to other parts of the website. The base language should be entered in the form of a 2 character language code - you can view a [http://code.google.com/intl/en/apis/ajaxlanguage/documentation/reference.html#LangNameArray Complete List of Available Language Codes] here (note that you do also need to check if [http://code.google.com/intl/en/apis/ajaxlanguage/documentation/#SupportedPairs translation is supported] from the applicable language).

For example, if the base language is English, you should configure the script to read as follows:  

{{{
var GL_baseLang = "en";
}}}

====Step 3(b):====

4. Upload the file _translate.js_ (as well as any changes made to any webpages in your site) to your server. Your work is complete!

The attached file _example.htm_ provides a very simple working example of the script in action. Please ensure that you have extracted both _example.htm_ and _translate.js_ from the archive into a new folder before opening the example. View the source of _example.htm_ to see comments describing how the script interacts with the page. For further examples and much more detailed usage instructions, please check the full documentation.
